        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Contrast:</strong> Strong contrast through clean typography,
            clear headings, and controlled color usage, making key content easy
            to find and read.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent fonts, spacing, button
            styles, and layout patterns across pages create a unified look and
            strong brand identity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alignment:</strong> Content follows a clear grid and lines
            up consistently, making the page feel organized and professional.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements (product info, pricing,
            calls-to-action) are grouped together, making the page easy to scan
            and understand.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Contrast:</strong> The contrast on the site is not very good
            because there is a lot of text and content on the page, but nothing
            really stands out. It can be hard to tell what information is most
            important.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repetition:</strong> There is very little repetition in the
            design. Fonts, layouts, and colors change between pages, which makes
            the site feel inconsistent and unorganized.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Alignment:</strong> The alignment is weak since many
            elements do not line up cleanly. The page feels cluttered and is
            difficult to read or scan quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proximity:</strong> Proximity is poor because related
            information is not always grouped together, while unrelated content
            is placed close to each other, making the page confusing to
            navigate.
