      <h2>Contract</h2>

      <p>
        I, Matthew R. Gibbs agree to abide by the terms of the course contract
        in my Spring 2026, ITIS 3135, Front-End Web Application Development with
        my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work
        that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the
        world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for
        schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is
        my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
        As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also
        understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s
        possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code
        directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and
        will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit
        (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed: Matthew
        R. Gibbs, 19/01/2026
